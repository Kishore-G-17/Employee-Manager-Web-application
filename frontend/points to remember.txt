Node(or)npm:
-> It is the runtime environment for executing the javascript outside the browser.

e2e:
-> This is where, we write our end-to-end tests for our application.
-> end-to-end tests are the automated tests.
-> It stimulates the real user so we can write the code to launch the browser navigate to the home 
page of our application.

node_modules:
-> This is where we store the third-party libraries used for our application.
-> This folder is purely for development purpose.
-> When we compile our application the parts of these third party libraries are put in a bundle and
deployed with the application itself.
-> So we don't need to deploy these third-party libraries to the server.


Points to remember:
-> <input #email="ngModel" required> 
   <div class="alert alert-danger *ngIf="email.touched && email.invalid" >
-> In the above code "email.invalid" property works only when we mentioned 'required' keyword to the input.
