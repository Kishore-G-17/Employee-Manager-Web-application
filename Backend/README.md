2. Refer this link to know about the folder structure of spring boot project  ~ "https://www.yawintutor.com/application-has-no-explicit-mapping-for-error-whitelabel-error-page-with-status-404/".
3. Refer this link to know about the JPA repository related error ~ "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61204612/exception-encountered-during-context-initialization-cancelling-refresh-attempt".
